        Initializes the VoiceRecognition class, setting up necessary models, streams, and queues.

        This class is not thread-safe, so you should only use it from one thread. It works like this:
        1. The audio stream is continuously listening for input.
        2. The audio is buffered until voice activity is detected. This is to make sure that the
            entire sentence is captured, including before voice activity is detected.
        2. While voice activity is detected, the audio is stored, together with the buffered audio.
        3. When voice activity is not detected after a short time (the PAUSE_LIMIT), the audio is
            transcribed. If voice is detected again during this time, the timer is reset and the
            recording continues.
        4. After the voice stops, the listening stops, and the audio is transcribed.
        5. If a wake word is set, the transcribed text is checked for similarity to the wake word.
        6. The function is called with the transcribed text as the argument.
        7. The audio stream is reset (buffers cleared), and listening continues.

        Args:
            asr_transcribe_func (Callable): The function to use for automatic speech recognition.
            wake_word (str, optional): The wake word to use for activation. Defaults to None.
